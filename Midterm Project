# Results: After running the code, it will produce five different shot charts for the Philadelphia 76ers from the seasons 2013-2018. The legend of the charts shows that the made shots are blue and the missed shots are red. In summary, we can see how the shot selection and shots made/missed percentages have changed over the course of five seasons.
